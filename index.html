					<h2>About</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I am a backend software engineer with a passion for writing code, the outdoors, and coffee.
					I got my start writing code in 2010 with a high school robotics team, and have been fascinated
					by it ever since. Software is not just a powerful and flexible tool in the modern world, but
					a way to think about problems. Finding problems, understanding them, and solving them is what
					being an engineer is all about. If you have any challenging problems, I would love to hear from you!

					<h2>Work</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I have a wide variety of academic and work interests, and have run the gamut of
					computer science subfields. I have a deep interest in computer security and the
					methods for protecting users data. I greatly enjoy the process of analyzing
					programs from an attackers view and finding creative solution to find and patch
					vulnerabilities. Ultimately my interest in Computer Science is a philosophical
					one of how to think through problems and answer tough questions.

						<div class="col-12">
							It is not enough to simply write code, but to deliver working code to the user. This
							requires CI/CD, containerization, microservices, performance monitoring, testing, and more.
							My
							experience with Censys has given me a large amount of experience in these areas. I have
							constructed
							data pipelines to ingest web data, transform that data into risks and vulnerabilities, and
							deliver
							that data to the user via a web portal and APIs. I have built gRPC microservices to support
							individual features of the Censys product. I have defined containers for each of these
							microservices
							and the associated Kubernetes charts. I have configured services with OpenTelemetry for
							observability
							and alerting. Learning how to write code that is easy to read, performant, and secure is a
							continual
							learning process, and I am always looking for ways to improve my capabilities.

						<div class="col-12">
							In graduate school, I worked with the <a href="https://sefcom.asu.edu/">Security Engineering
								for Future Computing (SEFCOM)</a> lab for my thesis and significant coursework. In
							classes led by
							SEFCOM faculty, I learned the techniques for binary, web, and network security. This
							included techniques
							like Buffer Overflows, Format String exploits, Loop Overflows (Off-by-One exploits), Return
							Oriented
							Programming, Spoofing (ARP, IP, TCP), Cross Site Scripting, and SQL Injection. These
							techniques were employed
							with the Capture the Flag (CTF) team the pwndevils. Pwndevils was established by Shellphish
							alumni and worked
							closely with the team, frequently attending DEFCOM CTF events with them. My research project
							for my thesis
							was the application of inductive programming techniques to exploit generation, which enabled
							the learning of
							basic expoits from examples in a CTF environment. This research is ongoing and pending
							future publication.
							My role with Censys was development of tools like <a
								href="https://censys.com/platform">Platform</a> advantages
							<a href="https://censys.com/solutions/attack-surface-management">Exposure Management</a> to
							enable users to
							identify vulnerabilities in their internet facing devices. Using internet wide scan data, we
							identified
							exposures and possible vulnerabilities and displayed them to the user via a web portal and
							APIs.

							Artificial Intelligence
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							I took multiple courses in artificial intelligence techniques, including heuristic searches,
							classifiers, clustering, and reinforcement learning. My graduate work included the
							mathematical
							foundations for algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Locality Sensitive
							Hashing,
							and Markov Decision Processes. My employment with the Navy involved the development of
							genetic
							algorithms to optimize aircraft Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). In my career
							with the
							Army, I developed a navigation system which generated a graph data structure from the
							terrain to
							enable intelligent path identification via heuristic searches, like A* and Djikstra, and
							optimization
							techniques like Ant Colony Optimization. I have also developed an architecture for
							Utility-driven
							AI which is used to define adaptive behaviors. The methodology for my thesis research,
							inductive
							programming, is an AI technique that uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) intersections to
							learn
							from examples.

							Scientific Computing
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							My career with the Department of Defense was in the field of Computational Sciences,
							specifically Combat Modeling. My first job with the Navy involved development of a
							deterministic, closed-form simulation used to evaluate aircraft Tactics, Techniques,
							and Procedures (TTPs). This simulation mutated Subject Matter Expert (SME) encoded
							strategies across a variety of scenarios to evaluate effectiveness of alternative TTPs.
							Our work involved not only algorithm development but the maintenance of the two hundred
							node, Windows Server cluster computer on which they were run. My work included performing
							updates and developing utilities for job submission and server maintenance. My role at the
							Army involved working a closed-form, Monte Carlo, discrete event combat simulator used for
							analysis of acquisition decisions. I have worked on defining automated and intelligent
							behaviors for entities within the simulation as well as extending the simulation to model
							new functionalities.

						<div class="col-12">
							Functional Programming
						</div>
						<div class="col-12">
							Since learning functional programming, I employ its techniques with growing regularity
							as a useful methodology for solving data transformation driven problems. Clojure is the
							most functional programming language I have used, but I reguarly apply the functional
							programming features of languages like Python and Java to create simpler solutions. The
							navigation suite I developed for the Army is mostly functional, with a Graph object that
							merely manages basic state information and all other methods being written independent of
							the object. This has the extra benefit of enabling these methods to be repurposed by other
							developers, who have used the resulting library for various projects. As part of my
							functional paradigm exploration, I studied Okasaki's foundational paper Purely Functional
							Data Structures, and utilize his techniques regularly to improve my code (lazy evaluation,
							memoization, and immutability).

				<header>
					<h2>Other Interests</h2>
				</header>
				<span class="icon solid fa-mountain fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock Climbing</span><br>
				<p>
					Rock climbing is a recent passion of mine, but one I have dedicated significant time to recently. I
					enjoy both the problem solving aspect - how do you move your body to progress upwards - as well as
					the strength and coordination it requires. I have learned to lead climb and am looking forward to
					climbing more outdoor routes in the future.
				</p>
				<span class="icon solid fa-map fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiking & Backpacking</span><br>
				<p>
					Since my time in Boy Scouts I have been an avid hiker. Backpacking was never as much of a passion of
					mine, but my interest in returning to it grew during pandemic lockdown. My partner, our dog, and I
					have begun backpacking again with a goal of completing a rim to rim trip of the Grand Canyon and Mt.
					Whitney.
				</p>
				<span class="icon solid fa-utensils fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking</span><br>
				<p>
					Cooking began as a necessity, not an interest. In college my roommate and I were living
					on our own, and had to feed ourselves. Since money was tight, eating out regularly was
					not an option. We began teaching ourselves how to cook, and became quite good as college
					progressed. I now cook both to eat healthy and to enjoy foods that I love, with recent
					recipes including Pad Thai, Falafel, Turkey with Red Chili Sauce, and Sous Vide Filet Minon,
					to name a few. I have also become quite good recently with my Latte machine.
				</p>
				<span class="icon solid fa-dumbbell fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weightlifting</span><br>
				<p>
					Weightlifting is a necessary training to gain and maintain the strength I need for other
					activities, like rock climbing. Beyond that my regular visits to the gym organize my day
					and motivate me. My current weightlifting goal is to build strength, increasing the
					weight for compound lifts to help improve my rock climbing.
				</p>
				<span class="icon solid fa-balance-scale fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy</span><br>
				<p>
					I have a keen interest in philosophy, especially the practical philosophies of the Hellenistic
					period. While philosophy is often portrayed as armchair theorizing, and some certainly
					is, others ask important questions about how we should live our lives and make
					difficult decisions. I am particularly interested in the Roman Stoic philosophers, whose
					virtue ethics emphasized the identification of what is within our control and was the basis
					for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
				</p>
				<!-- <span class="icon solid fa-bullseye fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archery</span><br>
				<p>
					Archery is a sport I was also introduced to during my time in Scouts and quickly grew to love.
					I find something more enticing with archery than other shooting sports - there is something very
					primal about shooting a bow. I would like to do more 3D shooting in the future.
